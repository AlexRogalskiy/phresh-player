### Reviews

> Bored of your current media player or just looking to try out a new one that works on all major OSes? If that's the case, you might want to consider giving PhreshPlayer a quick run-through.
Offers support for a wide array of media formats

>Right off the bat, we're going to say that this is not your typical full-featured media player. Instead, the application aims to deliver a set of typical and useful features in a very intuitive manner.

>We'll start off with one of its most useful features namely the fact that it comes with support for some of the most popular media formats out there such as MP4, MKV, WEBM, M4V, OGG, MOV, MP3, and FLAC.

>Even more interesting is the fact that if you happen to load files with other types of formats (let's say AVI or WMW), the utility automatically converts the files to MP4 and adds subsequently adds them to the playlist.
Intuitive and straightforward controls

>It also comes with support for a wide array of keyboard shortcuts and various mouse actions/events. For instance, you can quickly toggle the playlist by pressing the L key, fullscreen with F, mute with M, increase and decrease volume using the up and down arrows, and seek intervals of 5 seconds forward and backwards using the right and left arrows, just to name a few.

>There's also a right-click menu that allows you to toggle the fullscreen, the playlist, the always on top, and the subtitles on or off. You're also provided with the possibility to change the languages for both the GUI and the subtitles.
Good-looking, smooth-running, intuitive media player that only has one major drawback

>Taking everything into account, PhreshPlayer is a nice media player that is mostly aimed at users who prefer their media player to be on the minimalist side of things. It's also rather good-looking with its black-themed GUI, easy to install, and even easier to work with.
<a name="less-installation-space"></a>
>However, just like most other Electron-based apps, it does have one somewhat noteworthy disadvantage. Typing the scales at just about under 500 MB as tested (version 1.0.0), this is one very bulky media player, especially if you consider its minimalist feature set.
