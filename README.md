# Phreshplayer

Inspired by <a href="https://mpv.io/" target="_blank">mpv</a> player (with old hud) - I'm really liked it.. :( and <a href="https://potplayer.daum.net/" target="_blank">PotPlayer</a>.

Developed using <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron</a>.

**Keep It Simple!**

I'm sick of so much bullsh.t features in modern mediaplayers like kmp, vlc, etc.
Filters, useless view modes and more..

At last time I used PotPlayer but at this time is overhyped too.

The lot of extra features is it would be awesome, but finaly the program can't do that normally what it created first.
So I make my own..

I don't planning more features to the updates (exept audioTrack support/changes if will supported..), only neccessary bug fixes.

The Phresh media player is a simple and intuitive desktop app for Windows, Mac and Linux. It plays media files.. end of story.

In turn, I pays great attention to the naturality, easy and clear usage with much (and usual) keyboard shortcuts and some mouse gestures.

The player has an right click menu also for more powerful support the handling.

PhreshPlayer knows read the '.srt' subtitles also, only '.srt'. The '.sub' files not supported.

### 'Sorry bro, no mana..'

The electron (and the original too) Chromium/Chrome currently not support multi audio tracks in html 5 video players, so the language change unavilable yet in multi language videos.. :(

*Unfortunately I can't test on MacOS, so if you want better support for Mac, buy me a MacBook.. :D .. Or write to me the problems and deficiency what you found and i'll try to fix it.*
